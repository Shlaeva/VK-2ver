As the series celebrates twenty years since it was first released in Slovakia, publishing house IKAR have commissioned a new set of Harry Potter covers in an exclusive box set. Knowing the 20th anniversary of Harry Potter’s publication in Slovakia was fast approaching, IKAR publishing house knew they wanted to do something special to mark the occasion. They approached revered illustrator and graphic designer Adrián Macho, who they describe as a ‘die-hard’ Harry Potter fan. Welcome Adrián, you are amongst friends! Adrián worked with editor Alena Hošková for the best part of a year on all aspects of the artwork and these amazing covers are testament to how that work has paid off. The publishers say they believe their editions ‘will be some of the most beautiful ones in the world’ and we’re not about to argue with them.
